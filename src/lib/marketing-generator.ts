Hi [Name],

After months of work, I'm thrilled to announce that ${salesPage.courseName} is officially live!

This isn't just another course - it's the complete system I wish I had when I was starting out with ${course.title.toLowerCase()}.

${course.modules.map((module, index) => `Module ${index + 1}: ${module.title}\n${module.summary}`).join('\n\n')}

But here's the thing...

${salesPage.painPoints[0]}

That's exactly why I created this course. To give you a clear, step-by-step system that actually works.

When you join today, you'll also get:
${salesPage.pricingTiers[1].features.slice(1).map(feature => `‚úÖ ${feature}`).join('\n')}

SPECIAL LAUNCH PRICING:
For the next 48 hours only, you can get the complete course for just $${salesPage.pricingTiers[0].price} (normally $${salesPage.pricingTiers[1].price}).

This is the lowest price it will ever be.

Ready to transform your approach to ${course.title.toLowerCase()}?
